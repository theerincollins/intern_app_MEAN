        <p>Wow, fantastic venue/building with broad sweeping open interior space.  You will not feel cramped while in the dining area (which is really undefined from the bar) or at the bar top.The entrance is multiple garage doors that were open and just made the entire space really seem big.  Along with large windows West facing allowed much natural light into the open space.  It felt really comfortable!Now the important part, the beer!  I have to say that the variety and unique combinations and reserve beers they have in bottles was very interesting.The bartender was exceptionally helpful when it came to helping us out in selecting the brews we wanted to try.  She was able to give us really good descriptions so that we could make an educated guess on what we wanted, a nice touch to the overall experience. We found this place on our last day in Portland and it happens to be located across the Willamette River in a warehouse district that seems to be experiencing some revitalization.</p>
